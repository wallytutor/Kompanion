## To-do

The following aim at flattening the project of at least one level:

- [ ] Move `data/`, `downloads/`, `pkgs/`, `tests/`, and root-level files from `bin/` to root level.
- [ ] Move the contents of `bin/apps/` to `bin/`.
- [ ] Update Git submodules at `.gitmodules` and under `.git` directory at relevant locations.
- [ ] Integrate all the contents of `scripts/` directly under `activate.bat` in a better structured way.
- [ ] Under `data/` rename `julia-depot/` simply as `depot/` and update the related environment variable.
- [ ] Split the `Tested packages` of `docs/preamble.md` into sections for better management.
